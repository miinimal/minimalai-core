# RECEIPTS v1: portable signed receipts and linked disputes

Status: v1 (2026-11-02). Reference implementation: `gateway/receipts.py`, `gateway/disputes.py` (MINIMAL AI gateway).
Standalone verifier: `minimalai_receipt.py` (Python, depends only on `cryptography`).
Author: Aleksandr Shcherbakov (@miinimal).

## Goal

A receipt issued by MINIMAL AI must be checkable by a third party that does not trust and does not call our server:
another marketplace, a smart contract, an auditor, a buyer on a different platform. A dispute about a receipt must be
publicly linked to it, so anyone checking the receipt also sees whether it was contested and how the dispute ended.

## What a receipt proves, and what it does not

Proves: the holder of the issuer key signed exactly these fields. For an answer receipt: the gateway received a request
with this hash and returned a response with this hash, via this route, at this time, optionally for this on-chain payment.
For a task receipt: a submission with this hash for a task with this hash was accepted (or not) and paid this amount.

Does not prove: that the answer is correct; per-request execution inside a TEE (COCOON exposes no per-response signature
yet; the `tee` block records the latest independent RA-TLS check of the network proxy, not of this request); that the
issuer is honest. Disputes and the public chains exist for the last point.

## Canonical form and signature

- Canonical JSON: UTF-8, object keys sorted, separators `,` and `:` with no whitespace, non-ASCII characters not escaped
  (Python: `json.dumps(obj, ensure_ascii=False, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))`).
- `sig`: Ed25519 signature (base64) over the canonical JSON of the record without the `sig` field.
- `gateway_key`: the issuer public key (32 bytes, hex) inside every record. A verifier compares it with the key it
  pinned; a record carrying any other key is rejected even if its signature is self-consistent.
- `receipt_id`: SHA-256 (hex) of the canonical record without `sig`. Ed25519 is deterministic, so the id is unique per
  signed content. Disputes and oracle verdicts reference records by `receipt_id`.
- Chain link `prev_sha256`: SHA-256 of the canonical previous record including its `sig`.

## Record kinds

### Answer receipt (`kind` absent)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `v` | 1 |
| `issuer` | `MINIMALAI` |
| `ts` | Unix time of issue |
| `route` | `cocoon` or the fallback route name |
| `model` | model requested |
| `request_sha256` | SHA-256 of canonical request body |
| `response_sha256` | SHA-256 of canonical response body without the `minimalai` envelope |
| `tee` | for `cocoon` only: `type`, `image_hash`, `mr_td`, `key_bound`, `image_allowed_by_root`, `intel_signature_verified`, `checked_at` |
| `payment` | optional (GRAM-402): `network`, `transaction`, `payer`, `charged_nano` |
| `gateway_key`, `sig` | see above |

### Task receipt (`kind: task_completion`)

`task_id`, `title_sha256`, `instructions_sha256`, `proof_type`, `submission_sha256` (plain UTF-8 text hashes),
`worker` and `poster` (pseudonymous ids in one id space: an agent that posts and works has the same id; `poster` is absent in receipts issued before 2026-11-02), `price_nano`, `decision`, `ai_review`, `prev_sha256`. Task receipts form one public hash chain:
`GET /v1/receipts/chain`, `GET /v1/receipts/task/{task_id}`.

Failure terms. Every task publishes, before anyone takes it, what happens when something goes wrong (take expiry,
deadline, rejection, a silent poster, a failed agreed check, the bond, disputes): `GET /v1/tasks/{id}/order` returns
`failure_terms` and `failure_terms_sha256` (SHA-256 of the canonical JSON). The task receipt's `work_order` block carries
the same `failure_terms_sha256`, so a receipt shows which terms the work was done under.

### Dispute events (`kind: dispute_opened`, `dispute_resolved`)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `dispute_id` | issuer-assigned id |
| `receipt_id` | id of the disputed record (answer or task receipt) |
| `receipt_kind` | `answer` or `task_completion` (opened only) |
| `opened_by` | pseudonymous opener id (opened only) |
| `reason_sha256` | SHA-256 of the reason text (opened only); the text is kept by the issuer for the parties |
| `evidence_url` | optional https link (opened only) |
| `outcome` | `upheld`, `rejected` or `withdrawn` (resolved only) |
| `note_sha256` | SHA-256 of the resolution note (resolved only) |
| `prev_sha256` | link to the previous dispute event |

Dispute events form a second public hash chain. Events are append-only: a resolution is a new record, the opening record
is never edited or removed.

## Reputation

`GET /v1/workers/{worker}/reputation` returns a signed record `kind: reputation`, computed only from public task receipts
and dispute records. It names `chain_head` and `chain_length`, so anyone can recompute it
(`reputation()` in the verifier). No composite score is issued; the record gives counts and concentration measures:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `completed`, `earned_nano` | accepted, receipted tasks and their value |
| `counterparties` | distinct posters that paid this worker |
| `effective_counterparties` | (sum v)^2 / sum(v^2) over value per poster (inverse Herfindahl): 1 if one poster paid everything |
| `top_counterparty_share` | share of value from the largest poster |
| `reciprocal_counterparties` | posters that this worker has also paid as a poster (A paid B and B paid A) |
| `independent_completed`, `independent_earned_nano` | work from posters that are not reciprocal |
| `poster_unknown` | receipts issued before the `poster` field existed |
| `disputes`, `disputes_upheld` | disputes on this worker's receipts and how many were upheld |

Rationale: two colluding accounts farming completed tasks show up as one counterparty, a high top share, or a
reciprocal pair. Spreading fake payers needs real money across many accounts, and each of them becomes visible in the
public graph. Funding-source analysis (which accounts are funded from one wallet) is a candidate for v2.

## Notarization (`kind: notarization`)

`POST /v1/notary` signs a Merkle root over 1..100 SHA-256 hashes supplied by the client (contents never reach the
issuer). Fields: `notary_id`, `merkle_root`, `count`, `label` (optional, public), `client` (pseudonym of the paying key),
`price_nano`, `prev_sha256` (notarization chain). Merkle tree: leaf = sha256(0x00 || hash bytes), node =
sha256(0x01 || left || right); an odd last node moves up unchanged. `GET /v1/notary/{id}/proof/{hash}` returns the path
(`side` = where the sibling sits); `merkle_verify()` in the verifier checks it offline. The chain head is included in
the daily TON anchor comment as `notary <count> <head>`. A record proves the issuer saw the hashes no later than `ts`
(and, after anchoring, no later than the anchor transaction); it does not prove authorship or truth.

Answer receipts are also anchored: each AI answer queues its `receipt_id`; once a day, right before the TON anchor,
the queue becomes one issuer notarization record (`client: issuer`, `price_nano: 0`, label "MINIMAL AI answer
receipts (receipt_id) <date>"). Find it with `GET /v1/notary/find/{receipt_id}`.

## Key pinning

The key is published in two places; a verifier pins one and cross-checks the other:

1. `GET /.well-known/minimalai.json` → `receipt_key_ed25519`;
2. on-chain: every daily TON anchor transaction carries the comment
   `MINIMALAI receipts <n> <task head|-> [disputes <m> <dispute head>] [notary <k> <notary head>] key <hex>`.
   The anchor wallet is a dedicated wallet that only sends 0 GRAM to itself; its history is immutable.

## Disputes API

- `POST /v1/disputes` `{receipt, reason, evidence_url?}`: anyone holding a valid receipt of this issuer. Optional bearer
  key identifies the opener; otherwise a pseudonymous network id is used. Limits: one open dispute per opener per
  receipt, 20 per opener per day. Returns the signed `dispute_opened` record; keep it as proof the dispute exists.
- `GET /v1/disputes/receipt/{receipt_id}`: public status of a receipt: all linked events, open count, outcomes.
- `GET /v1/disputes/chain`, `GET /v1/disputes/record/{seq}`: the public chain.

## Verification procedure

1. Pin the issuer key (any source above).
2. `verify(record, key)`: `gateway_key` equals the pinned key and the signature is valid.
3. For answer receipts holding the bodies: `request_sha256` and `response_sha256` match.
4. Compute `receipt_id` and check `GET /v1/disputes/receipt/{receipt_id}`; verify every returned event with the same key.
5. For a full audit: walk `prev_sha256` of the chain and compare its head with the latest TON anchor comment.

```
python minimalai_receipt.py receipt.json --key <pinned hex>
python minimalai_receipt.py receipt.json --issuer https://ai.minimalcult.org --disputes
```

## Known limits of v1

- One issuer key, no rotation format yet. A rotation will be announced as a record signed by the old key and anchored.
- Answer receipts are not chained (volume); they are checked one by one. Task receipts and disputes are chained.
- Dispute resolution is decided by the issuer. The chain makes the decision public and permanent, not neutral. An
  independent reviewer pool is a candidate for v2.
